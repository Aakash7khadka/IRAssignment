The American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) was founded in 1930 for the purpose of "dissemination of knowledge of physics, particularly by way of teaching." There are more than 10,000 members in over 30 countries. AAPT publications include two peer-reviewed journals, the American Journal of Physics and The Physics Teacher. The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators, including the Richtmyer Memorial Award and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in College Park, Maryland.
