The Feynman Lectures on Physics is a physics textbook based on a great number of lectures by Richard Feynman, a Nobel laureate who has sometimes been called "The Great Explainer". The lectures were presented before undergraduate students at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), during 1961â€“1964.  The book's co-authors are Feynman, Robert B. Leighton, and Matthew Sands.
A 2013 review in Nature described the book as having "simplicity, beauty, unity ... presented with enthusiasm and insight".
