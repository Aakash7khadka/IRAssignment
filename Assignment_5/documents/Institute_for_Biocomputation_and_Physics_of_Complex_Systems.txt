The Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI) is a research center of the University of Zaragoza devoted to the study of complex systems from a multidisciplinary perspective. Biochemists, physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and researchers from other fields study complex systems, as well as different phenomena and processes related to them (protein folding, interaction between diseases, the spread of epidemics, multi-layer networks, collective social phenomena, etc.).  The ultimate goal is to unravel various aspects of complexity, promote basic science and assess the impact of applied research and possible benefits for society.
