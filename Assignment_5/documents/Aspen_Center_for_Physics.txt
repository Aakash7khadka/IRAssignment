The Aspen Center for Physics (ACP) is a non-profit institution for physics research located in Aspen, Colorado, in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States. Since its foundation in 1962, it has hosted distinguished physicists for short-term visits during seasonal winter and summer programs, to promote collaborative research in fields including astrophysics, cosmology, condensed matter physics, string theory, quantum physics, biophysics, and more.
To date, sixty-six of the center's affiliates have won Nobel Prizes in Physics and three have won Fields Medals in mathematics. Its affiliates have garnered a wide array of other national and international distinctions, among them the Abel Prize, the Dirac Medal, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the MacArthur Prize, and the Breakthrough Prize. Its visitors have included figures such as the cosmologist and gravitational theorist Stephen Hawking, the particle physicist Murray Gell-Mann, the condensed matter theorist Philip W. Anderson, and the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher.
In addition to serving as a locus for physics research, the ACP's mission has entailed public outreach: offering programs to educate the general public about physics and to stimulate interest in the subject among youth.
