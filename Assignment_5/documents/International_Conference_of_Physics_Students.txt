The International Conference of Physics Students (ICPS) is an annual conference of the International Association of Physics Students (IAPS).  Usually, up to 500 students from all over the world attend the event, which takes place in another country every year in August. The event includes the opportunity for students at bachelor, master and doctoral level to present their research, whilst listening and interacting with invited speakers of international reputation. During the event, usually lasting between 5 and 7 days, the IAPS holds its Annual General Meeting (AGM) and elects a new Executive Committee. The choice of the host country of ICPS is made two years in advance.
