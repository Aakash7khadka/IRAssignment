Soil physics is the study of soil's physical properties and processes. It is applied to  management and prediction under natural and managed ecosystems.  Soil physics deals with the dynamics of physical soil components and their phases as solids, liquids, and gases. It draws on the principles of physics, physical chemistry, engineering, and meteorology.  Soil physics applies these principles to address practical problems of agriculture, ecology, and engineering.
