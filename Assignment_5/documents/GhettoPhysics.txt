GhettoPhysics: Will the Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! is a 2010 docudrama film written and directed by William Arntz and E. Raymond Brown.  The film is based on Brown's 2003 book, Will The Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! — Peeping the Multi-leveled Global Game. The book and the film examine the interplay between Pimps and "Hos" and how that dynamic is the oldest and simplest expression of the ways in which power is wielded in today's world.  The film uses documentary footage, animation, satire and dramatization to illustrate examples culled from the "hood" to Wall Street. Whether the players are real-life pimps or corporate executives, they are all playing the “game” and repeating the same power dynamics.
On the decision to utilize the Pimp/Ho metaphor for the film, Arntz and Brown explain, "We don’t normally refer to power interactions in say, politics or economics as a game.  But this is exactly what is taking place.  GhettoPhysics helps you become more aware of it and play it from a position of personal power."
