Quantization (in British English quantisation) is the  systematic transition procedure from a classical understanding of physical phenomena to a newer understanding known as quantum mechanics.  It is a procedure for constructing  quantum mechanics from classical mechanics.  A generalization involving infinite degrees of freedom  is field quantization, as in the "quantization of the electromagnetic field", referring to photons as field "quanta" (for instance as light quanta). This procedure is basic to theories of atomic physics, chemistry, particle physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum optics.
