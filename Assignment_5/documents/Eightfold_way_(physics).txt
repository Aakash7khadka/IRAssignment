In physics, the eightfold way is an organizational scheme for a class of subatomic particles known as hadrons that led to the development of the quark model. Both the American physicist Murray Gell-Mann and the Israeli physicist Yuval Ne'eman independently and simultaneously proposed the idea in 1961.
The name comes from Gell-Mann's (1961) paper and is an allusion to the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism.
