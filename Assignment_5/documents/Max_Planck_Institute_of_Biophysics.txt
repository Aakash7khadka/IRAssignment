The Max Planck Institute of Biophysics (German: Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik) is located in Frankfurt, Germany. It was founded as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics in 1937, and moved into a new building in 2003. It is an institute of the Max Planck Society.
Since March 2003, the MPI for Biophysics has resided in a new building on the Riedberg campus of the Goethe University Frankfurt in the north of the city. At the end of 2016, a total of 178 employees were working at the institute, including 48 scientists and 50 junior researchers. The Nobel Prize winner Hartmut Michel was the director of the institute starting 1987 until he was replaced by Ana J. García-Sáez in October 2023. Scientific links to fellow researchers at Goethe University have been strengthened further, as the institute is now situated next to the university's biology, chemistry and physics laboratories. Together with the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research and the Goethe University the institute run the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, a graduate program offering a Ph.D. in the period from 2000 until 2012.
