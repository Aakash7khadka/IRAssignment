The Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics (基礎物理学研究所, kiso butsurigaku kenkyūsho) is a research institute in the field of theoretical physics, attached to Kyoto University in Japan. It was inaugurated in 1952.
While the center is often referred to as "YITP", this can be confusing as YITP also stands for the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook University in the United States.
