The National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology  (Inria) (French: Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du num√©rique) is a French national research institution focusing on computer science and applied mathematics.
It was created under the name French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (IRIA) (French: Institut de recherche en informatique et en automatique) in 1967 at Rocquencourt near Paris, part of Plan Calcul. Its first site was the historical premises of SHAPE (central command of NATO military forces), which is still used as Inria's main headquarters. In 1980, IRIA became INRIA. Since 2011, it has been styled Inria.
Inria is a Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment (EPST) under the double supervision of the French Ministry of National Education, Advanced Instruction and Research and the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry.
