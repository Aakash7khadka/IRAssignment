National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS) in Taiwan was established on August 1, 1997 and fully funded by the National Science Council (NSC), which is reorganized and became Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) (MoST) in 2014, with strong endorsement from some of the most eminent scholars, including Yang Chen-Ning and Shing-Tung Yau. It is a national research center with the goal to contribute to the advancement of frontier research, and to promote interdisciplinary and international research cooperation in theoretical sciences.
NCTS was set up with a center in Theoretical Physics and one in Mathematics. For the first 18 years, NCTS was located on the campus of the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu. Since 2015, NCTS Mathematics has been relocated to the National Taiwan University, Taipei. NCTS Physics and NCTS Mathematics operate mostly independently to serve their separate communities and cooperate on some of their national programs and strategies. Tung-Mow Yan was the founder director of NCTS.
Previous directors of the Physics Division were Tung-Mow Yan, Ting-Kuo Lee, Darwin Chang, Tu-Nan Chang, Hsiang-Nan Li, Chung-Yu Mou, Ling-Fong Li, Xiao-Gang He, and Chong-Sun Chu. The current director is Guang-Yu Guo.
