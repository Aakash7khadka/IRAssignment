Physics Correspondence Seminar (FKS) is a correspondence competition primarily aimed at high school students in Slovakia. Its purpose is to provide an outlet for talented individuals by creating challenging problems and organising academic camps. The seminar organisers are mostly undergraduate students from the FMFI, Comenius University, Slovakia and other distinguished universities, such as Cambridge University. FKS is part of Trojsten, an NGO supporting educational activities in Slovakia in the field of mathematics, physics and computer science.
The purpose of the FKS is, firstly, to motivate high school students to become proficient in physics and problem solving in general; secondly, to prepare some of the students for international competitions such as the International Physics Olympiad, International Young Physicists' Tournament); and thirdly, to support them in preparing for studies at world's top universities, such as Oxford University, Cambridge University or Ivy League colleges. The alumni are well-positioned to become university researchers or engineers at prominent IT companies.
