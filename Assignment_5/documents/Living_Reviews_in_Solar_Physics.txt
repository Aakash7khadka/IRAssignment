Living Reviews in Solar Physics is a peer-reviewed open-access scientific journal publishing reviews on all areas of solar and heliospheric physics. It was founded and published at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research from 2004 to 2015. After it was sold by the Max Planck Society in June 2015, it is now published by the academic publisher Springer Science+Business Media.
The articles in Living Reviews provide critical reviews of the current state of research in the fields they cover.
