University Physics, informally known as the Sears & Zemansky, is the name of a two-volume physics textbook written by Hugh Young and Roger Freedman. The first edition of University Physics was published by Mark Zemansky and Francis Sears in 1949. Hugh Young became a coauthor with Sears and Zemansky in 1973. Now in its 15th edition, University Physics is among the most widely used introductory textbooks in the world.
University Physics by Pearson is not to be confused with a free textbook by the same name, available from OpenStax.
