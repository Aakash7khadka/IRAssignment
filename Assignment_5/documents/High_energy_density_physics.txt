High-energy-density physics (HEDP) is a subfield of physics intersecting condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics and plasma physics. It has been defined as the physics of matter and radiation at energy densities in excess of about 100 GJ/m3 equivalent to pressures of about 1 Mbar (or roughly 1 million times atmospheric pressure).
