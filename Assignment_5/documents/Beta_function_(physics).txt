In theoretical physics, specifically quantum field theory, a beta function, β(g), encodes the dependence of a coupling parameter, g, on the energy scale,  μ,  of a given physical process described by quantum field theory.
It is defined as

  
    
      
        β
        (
        g
        )
        =
        μ
        
          
            
              ∂
              g
            
            
              ∂
              μ
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              ∂
              g
            
            
              ∂
              ln
              ⁡
              (
              μ
              )
            
          
        
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta (g)=\mu {\frac {\partial g}{\partial \mu }}={\frac {\partial g}{\partial \ln(\mu )}}~,}
  

and, because of the underlying  renormalization group, it has no explicit dependence on μ, so it only depends on μ implicitly through  g.
This dependence on the energy scale thus specified is known as the running of the coupling parameter, a fundamental 
feature of  scale-dependence in quantum field theory, and its explicit computation is achievable through a variety of mathematical techniques. The concept of Beta function was Introduced by Ernst Stueckelberg and André Petermann in 1953.
