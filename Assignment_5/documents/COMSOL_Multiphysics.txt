COMSOL Multiphysics is a finite element analyzer, solver, and simulation software package for various physics and engineering applications, especially coupled phenomena and multiphysics. The software facilitates conventional physics-based user interfaces and coupled systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). COMSOL Multiphysics provides an IDE and unified workflow for electrical, mechanical, fluid, acoustics, and chemical applications.
Beside the classical problems that can be addressed with application modules, the core Multiphysics package can be used to solve PDEs in weak form. An API for Java and MATLAB can be used to control the software externally. The program also serves as an application builder for physics applications. Several modules are available for COMSOL, categorized according to the applications areas of Electrical, Mechanical, Fluid, Acoustic, Chemical, Multipurpose, and Interfacing.
