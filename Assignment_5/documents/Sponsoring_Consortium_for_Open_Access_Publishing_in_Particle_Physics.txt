The Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (or SCOAP3) is an international collaboration in the high-energy physics community to convert traditional closed access physics journals to open access, freely available for everyone to read and reuse, shifting away the burden of the publishing cost from readers (traditional model) and authors (in the case of hybrid open access journals). Under the terms of the agreement, authors retain copyrights and the articles published under SCOAP3 will be in perpetuity under a CC BY license. The initiative was promoted by CERN in collaboration with international partners.
Participating countries in the agreement sponsor SCOAP3 journals through the consortium, and contribute according to their scientific output. More productive countries pay more, while lower-output countries pay less.
