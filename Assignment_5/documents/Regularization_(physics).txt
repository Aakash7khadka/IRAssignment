In physics, especially quantum field theory, regularization is a method of modifying observables which have singularities in order to make them finite by the introduction of a suitable parameter called the regulator.    The regulator, also known as a "cutoff", models our lack of knowledge about physics at unobserved scales (e.g. scales of small size or large energy levels).  It compensates for (and requires) the possibility of separation of scales that "new physics" may be discovered at those scales which the present theory is unable to model, while enabling the current theory to give accurate predictions as an "effective theory" within its intended scale of use.
It is distinct from renormalization, another technique to control infinities without assuming new physics, by adjusting for self-interaction feedback.
Regularization was for many decades controversial even amongst its inventors, as it combines physical and epistemological claims into the same equations.   However, it is now well understood and has proven to yield useful, accurate predictions.
