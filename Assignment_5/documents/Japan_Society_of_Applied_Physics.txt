The Japan Society of Applied Physics (応用物理学会, ōyō butsuri gakkai) (JSAP) is a Japanese group of researchers in the field of applied physics. JSAP originated in 1932 from a voluntary forum of researchers belonging to the University of Tokyo and the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research. During World War II, most research, even applied, was frozen. In 1946, the society was established as an official academic society.
