Clinical biophysics is that branch of medical science that studies the action process and the effects of non-ionising physical energies utilised for therapeutic purposes. 
Physical energy can be applied for diagnostic or therapeutic aims.
The principle on which clinical biophysics is based are represented by the recognizability and the specificity of the physical signal applied:

recognizability: the capacity of the biological target to recognise the presence of the physical energy: this aspect becomes more important with the lowering of the energy applied.
specificity: the capacity of the physical agent applied to the biological target to obtain a response depending on its physical characteristics: frequency, length, energy, etc. The effects do not necessarily depend on the quantity of energy applied to the biological target.
