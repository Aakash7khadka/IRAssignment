The International Journal of Geometric Methods in Modern Physics (IJGMMP) is a peer-reviewed journal, published by World Scientific, covering mathematical physics. It was originally published bimonthly beginning in January 2004; as of 2006 it appears 8 times a year, and as of 2024 it appears 14 times a year. Editorial policy for the journal specifies that "The journal publishes short communications, research and review articles devoted to the application of geometric methods (including differential geometry, algebraic geometry, global analysis and topology) to quantum field theory, non-perturbative quantum gravity, string and brane theory, quantum mechanics, semi-classical approximations in quantum theory, quantum thermodynamics and statistical physics, quantum computation and control theory."
