Experimental science demands repeatability of results, but many experiments are not repeatable due to fraud or error. The list of papers whose results were later retracted or discredited, thus leading to invalid science, is growing. Some errors are introduced when the experimenter's desire for a certain result unconsciously influences selection of data (a problem which is possible to avoid in some cases with double-blind protocols). There have also been cases of deliberate scientific misconduct.
