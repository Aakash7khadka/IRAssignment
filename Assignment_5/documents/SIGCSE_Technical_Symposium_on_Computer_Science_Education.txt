The Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) Technical Symposium is the main ACM conference for computer science educators. It has been held annually in February or March in the United States since 1970, with the exception of 2020 when it was cancelled due to COVID-19. In 2019, there were 1,809 attendees and 994 total submissions from over 50 countries, with a total of 2,668 unique authors representing over 800 institutions and organizations. There were 526 paper submissions (up 15% on 2018), with 169 papers accepted across the three paper tracks (CS Education Research, Experience Reports & Tools, and Curricula Initiatives) which was up 5% over 2018. It is a CORE A Conference.
SIGCSE members often refer to the Symposium as "SIGCSE" (pronounced SIG-see), as in "Are you going to SIGCSE this year?" or "I attended her talk at last year's SIGCSE". Thus, while "SIGCSE" refers to the ACM Special Interest Group (SIG) that is SIGCSE, it also refers to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.
