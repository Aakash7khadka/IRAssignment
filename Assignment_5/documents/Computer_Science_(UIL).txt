Computer science is one of several academic events sanctioned by the University Interscholastic League (UIL).
Computer science is designed to test students' programming abilities. It is not the same as the Computer Applications contest, which tests students' abilities to use word processing, spreadsheet, and database applications software, including integration of applications.
Computer science began during the 1990-91 scholastic year as strictly a team event. It was not scored as an individual event until the 1996-97 school year.
