The stemma codicum of Aristotle's Metaphysics is a visual representation with the shape of a family tree, which is the standard one in stemmatics. It is meant to show the relationships of the surviving manuscripts of the Greek text, with special reference to those which are to be taken into account for a critical edition, hence for translations in modern languages, for commentaries, and for any other kind of scholarly reference to the text of the Metaphysics. It is partly conjectural by its own nature and it is an object of lively debate, since these latest years especially.
