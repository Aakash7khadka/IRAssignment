This list of geophysics awards is an index to articles on notable awards for contributions to geophysics, the branch of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis.
The list gives the country of the organization that sponsors the award, but the awards are not necessarily limited to people from that country.
