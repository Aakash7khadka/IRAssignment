The Institute of Physics (IOP) of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Ukrainian: Інститут фізики Національної академії наук України) founded in 1926 is the oldest research institution of physical science within the academy. Being on the path of both infrastructure development and research diversification for more than 80 years, the institute has eventually originated five more specialized research institutions.
Currently, the institute employs more than 300 researchers (together with two full members and eight corresponding members of the NASU) and around 200 peoples of supporting personnel. It has more than 20 scientific units (including the state-of-the-art Femtosecond Laser Complex) which are grouped around four research programs
Traditionally, the institute is focused on fundamental research. At the same time, applied research on cryogenics, LC displays, laser systems, pyroelectric detectors, biophysics and plasma technologies strengthen the institute's activities.
The IOP is consistently ranked at the top of national academic institutions ranking. Besides, international reputation of IOP is growing constantly as prominent scientists from the Institute expand their activity to leading foreign research centers and universities.
