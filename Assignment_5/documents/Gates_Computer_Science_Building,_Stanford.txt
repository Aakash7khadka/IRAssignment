The Gates Computer Science Building, or Gates building for short, is an L-shaped building that houses the Computer Science Department as well as the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) at 353 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford University, California. Construction on the building began in 1994 and was completed in 1996 at a cost of $36 million. It was named after Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who donated $6 million for the building's construction.
The building is organized into an A wing (the western ell) and a B wing (the northern ell). Blueprints of the building are available online. The building was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects of New York City. The building was renovated in 2020-2021, while many Stanford buildings were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
