In physics, a force field is a vector field corresponding with a non-contact force acting on a particle at various positions in space. Specifically, a force field is a vector field 
  
    
      
        
          F
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }
  
, where 
  
    
      
        
          F
        
        (
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}
  
 is the force that a particle would feel if it were at the position 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
  
.
