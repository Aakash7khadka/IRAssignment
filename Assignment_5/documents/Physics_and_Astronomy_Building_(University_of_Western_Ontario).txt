The Physics and Astronomy Building, historically known as the Science Building, is an academic building of the University of Western Ontario on its main campus in London, Ontario. The building was the one of two erected on the present campus site in 1922, with the other building being University College. The design is a good example of collegiate Gothic architecture and its early use on the university campus and in the London area. In 2012, the building was renovated and awarded LEED Silver certification. It currently houses the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
