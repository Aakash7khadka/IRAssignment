In physics, the term clusters denotes small, polyatomic particles. As a rule of thumb, any particle made of between 3×100 and 3×107 atoms is considered a cluster. 
The term can also refer to the organization of protons and neutrons within an atomic nucleus, e.g. the alpha particle (also known as "α-cluster"), consisting of two protons and two neutrons (as in a helium nucleus).
