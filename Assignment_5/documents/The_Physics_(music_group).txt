The Physics is an American hip hop group based in Seattle, Washington. It was created in the late-1990s when its members, Thig Natural (Gathigi Gishuru), Monk Wordsmith (Njuguna Gishuru) and Just D'Amato (Justin Hare) were students at O'Dea High School in Seattle. Since 2007, the trio has released three full-length albums, two EPs and several non-album singles.
The Physics are an integral part of the Seattle hip hop community, and much of their music is centered on life in Seattle ("Seward Park" and "Coronas on Madrona," for example). They are known for rapping about everyman themes such as romance, working 9-5 jobs, and enjoying life.
