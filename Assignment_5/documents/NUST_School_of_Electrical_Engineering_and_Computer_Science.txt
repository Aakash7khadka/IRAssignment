NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (NUST-SEECS), formerly NUST Institute of Information Technology, is a constituent school in Islamabad, Pakistan. It was created on a self-financed basis in April 1999 as a constituent college of National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan (NUST). The formation of NUST was prompted by the growing need for high-caliber IT instruction in the country and the necessity for the institution to establish its own IT division.
