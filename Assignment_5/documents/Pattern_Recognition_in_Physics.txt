Pattern Recognition in Physics was an open-access journal originally published by Copernicus Publications which was established in March 2013 and terminated in January 2014. The editors-in-chief were Sid-Ali Ouadfeul (Algerian Petroleum Institute) and Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner. Copernicus ceased its publication due to concerns over the publication's method of peer review, which it calls "nepotistic reviewing and malpractice" facilitating views contradicting the scientific consensus on climate change.
