International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI) is an international organization promoting the study of earthquakes and other seismic sources, the propagation of seismic waves, and the internal structure, properties and processes of the Earth.
IASPEI is one of eight associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). IASPEI initiates and co-ordinates international researches and scientific discussion on scientific and applied seismology.
The activities of IASPEI focus on the societal impacts of earthquakes and tsunamis, with four regional commissions promoting high standards of seismological education, outreach and international scientific cooperation.
