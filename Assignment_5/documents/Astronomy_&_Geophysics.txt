Astronomy & Geophysics (A&G) is a scientific journal and trade magazine published on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) by Oxford University Press. It is distributed bimonthly to members of the RAS.
A&G publishes content of interest to professional astronomers and geophysicists, including: news reports, interviews, topical reviews, historical investigations, obituaries, meeting reports and updates on the activities of the RAS. Full-length articles are peer-reviewed, but A&G does not publish original research papers.
A&G was established in 1997 as a glossy magazine replacement for the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society (QJRAS; 1960â€“1996); it continues the same volume numbering from QJRAS. The editor is Sue Bowler of the University of Leeds.
