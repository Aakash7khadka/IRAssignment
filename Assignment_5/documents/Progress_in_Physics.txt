Progress in Physics is an open-access academic journal, publishing papers in theoretical and experimental physics, including related themes from mathematics. The journal was founded by Dmitri Rabounski, Florentin Smarandache, and Larissa Borissova in 2005, and is published quarterly. Rabounski is the editor-in-chief, while Smarandache and Borissova act as associate editors. It was included on Beall's List of potentially-predatory journals at the time that list was last updated. Since 2008, the Norwegian Scientific Index has rated it a "Level 0" journal, indicating that publication there does not count for official academic career or public funding purposes.
