Letters in Mathematical Physics is a peer-reviewed scientific journal in mathematical physics published by Springer Science+Business Media. It publishes letters and longer research articles, occasionally also articles containing topical reviews. It is essentially a platform for the rapid dissemination of short contributions in the field of mathematical physics. In addition, the journal publishes contributions to modern mathematics in fields which have a potential physical application, and developments in theoretical physics which have potential mathematical impact. The editors are Volker Bach, Edward Frenkel, Maxim Kontsevich, Dirk Kreimer, Nikita Nekrasov, Massimo Porrati, and Daniel Sternheimer.
