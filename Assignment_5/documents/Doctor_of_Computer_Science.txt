The degree of Doctor of Computer Science (DCS, DCompSci, DSc.Comp, D.C.Sc.) is an applied research doctorate in computer science awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of computer science. While it is considered a terminal degree and requires coursework and research beyond the masters' level, the DCS is not considered equivalent to a Ph.D. or a Doctor of Science (D.Sc. or Sc.D) in computer science.
