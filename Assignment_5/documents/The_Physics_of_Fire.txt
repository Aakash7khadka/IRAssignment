The Physics of Fire is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Becoming the Archetype. Released on May 8, 2007, the album shows the band shifting to a more progressive death metal sound. While the metalcore influences are still there, they are not as prominent as they were on Terminate Damnation. This is also the first and only album featuring Aletheian guitarist Alex Kenis.
