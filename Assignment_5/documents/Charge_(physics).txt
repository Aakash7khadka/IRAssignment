In physics, a charge is any of many different quantities, such as the electric charge in electromagnetism or the color charge in quantum chromodynamics. Charges correspond to the time-invariant generators of a symmetry group, and specifically, to the generators that commute with the Hamiltonian.  Charges are often denoted by 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  
, and so the invariance of the charge corresponds to the vanishing commutator 
  
    
      
        [
        Q
        ,
        H
        ]
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle [Q,H]=0}
  
, where 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  
 is the Hamiltonian. Thus, charges are associated with conserved quantum numbers; these are the eigenvalues of the generator 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  
. A "charge" can also refer to a point-shaped object with an electric charge and a position, such as in the method of image charges.
