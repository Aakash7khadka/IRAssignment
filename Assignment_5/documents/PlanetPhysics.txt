PlanetPhysics was a virtual community with several Internet sites  supported by a non-profit organization registered in the USA in an open science, open data, peer-to-peer review mode that aimed to help make physics, and related mathematics, knowledge much more accessible, as well as to further develop physical, logical, computational and mathematical physics concepts.
PlanetPhysics was also a free, collaborative, online physics, mathematical physics, computational physics and physical mathematics project, including original articles, lectures, books and  encyclopedia entries.  The emphasis was on openness, pedagogy, real-time content, rigour, interlinked content, and also based on a virtual community, or virtual group, of about 600 people with various physics, mathematical physics, physical mathematics, logic (such as quantum logic, relational logic and many-valued logics), axiomatics and mathematics interests.
