The SAT Subject Test in Physics, Physics SAT II, or simply the Physics SAT, was a one-hour multiple choice test on physics administered by the College Board in the United States. A high school student generally chose to take the test to fulfill college entrance requirements for the schools at which the student was planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests; until January 2005, they were known as SAT IIs; they are still well known by this name.
The material tested on the Physics SAT was supposed to be equivalent to that taught in a junior- or senior-level high school physics class. It required critical thinking and test-taking strategies, at which high school freshmen or sophomores may have been inexperienced. The Physics SAT tested more than what normal state requirements were; therefore, many students prepared for the Physics SAT using a preparatory book or by taking an AP course in physics.
On January 19 2021, the College Board discontinued all SAT Subject tests, including the SAT Subject Test in Physics. This was effective immediately in the United States, and the tests were to be phased out by the following summer for international students. This was done as a response to changes in college admissions due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education.
