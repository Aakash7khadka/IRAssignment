The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics is a comprehensive one-volume reference resource for science research. First published in 1914, it is currently (as of 2024) in its 105th edition, published in 2024. It is known colloquially among chemists as the "Rubber Bible", as CRC originally stood for "Chemical Rubber Company".
As late as the 1962â€“1963 edition (3604 pages), the Handbook contained myriad information for every branch of science and engineering.  Sections in that edition include: Mathematics, Properties and Physical Constants, Chemical Tables, Properties of Matter, Heat, Hygrometric and Barometric Tables, Sound, Quantities and Units, and Miscellaneous.  Mathematical Tables from Handbook of Chemistry and Physics was originally published as a supplement to the handbook up to the 9th edition (1952); afterwards, the 10th edition (1956) was published separately as CRC Standard Mathematical Tables.  Earlier editions included sections such as "Antidotes of Poisons", "Rules for Naming Organic Compounds", "Surface Tension of Fused Salts", "Percent Composition of Anti-Freeze Solutions", "Spark-gap Voltages", "Greek Alphabet", "Musical Scales", "Pigments and Dyes", "Comparison of Tons and Pounds", "Twist Drill and Steel Wire Gauges" and "Properties of the Earth's Atmosphere at Elevations up to 160 Kilometers".  Later editions focus almost exclusively on chemistry and physics topics and eliminated much of the more "common" information. 
CRC Press is a leading publisher of engineering handbooks and references and textbooks across virtually all scientific disciplines.
