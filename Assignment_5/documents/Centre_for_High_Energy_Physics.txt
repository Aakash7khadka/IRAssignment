The Centre for High Energy Physics (CHEP) is a federally funded national research laboratory managed by the University of Punjab.  
The CHEP is dedicated towards the scientific advancement and understanding of high energy physics (or particle physics) â€” a branch of fundamental physics that is concerned with unraveling the ultimate constituents of matter and with elucidating the forces between them.
The site was established in 1982 with efforts by Punjab University with federal funding to support research activities in quantum sciences that started in 1968, and later engaged in the supercomputing that started in 2004.
