In astrophysics, what is referred to as "entropy" is actually the adiabatic constant derived as follows.
Using the first law of thermodynamics for a quasi-static, infinitesimal process for a hydrostatic system

  
    
      
        d
        Q
        =
        d
        U
        −
        d
        W
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle dQ=dU-dW.}
  
  
For an ideal gas in this special case, the internal energy, U, is a function of only the temperature T; therefore the partial derivative of heat capacity with respect to T is identically the same as the full derivative, yielding through some manipulation

  
    
      
        d
        Q
        =
        
          C
          
            v
          
        
        d
        T
        +
        P
        
        d
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle dQ=C_{\text{v}}dT+P\,dV.}
  

Further manipulation using the differential version of the ideal gas law, the previous equation, and assuming constant pressure, one finds

  
    
      
        d
        Q
        =
        
          C
          
            p
          
        
        d
        T
        −
        V
        
        d
        P
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle dQ=C_{\text{p}}dT-V\,dP.}
  

For an adiabatic process 
  
    
      
        d
        Q
        =
        0
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle dQ=0\,}
  
 and recalling 
  
    
      
        γ
        =
        
          
            C
            
              p
            
          
        
        
          /
        
        
          
            C
            
              v
            
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ={C_{\text{p}}}/{C_{\text{v}}}\,}
  
,  one finds

One can solve this simple differential equation to find

  
    
      
        P
        
          V
          
            γ
          
        
        =
        
          constant
        
        =
        K
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV^{\gamma }={\text{constant}}=K}
  

This equation is known as an expression for the adiabatic constant, K, also called the adiabat. From the ideal gas equation one also knows

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle P={\frac {\rho k_{\text{B}}T}{\mu m_{\text{H}}}},}

 is the Boltzmann constant.
Substituting this into the above equation along with 
  
    
      
        V
        =
        [
        
          g
        
        ]
        
          /
        
        ρ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V=[\mathrm {g} ]/\rho \,}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        γ
        =

        3
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma =5/3\,}

This is what astrophysicists refer to as "entropy" and has units of [keV⋅cm2]. This quantity relates to the thermodynamic entropy as
