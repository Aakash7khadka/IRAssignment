"Christian Metaphysics and Neoplatonism" (1936) is the title of Albert Camus' thesis that would obtain for him permission to teach in the secondary schools of France. It was published when Camus was 23 years old. Camus uses Augustine of Hippo and Pelagius to elaborate his moral views in regard to Greek thought and Christianity. This book is important as it is the first attempt of Camus to explore humanist ethics.
Although it has never been published separately, this text was included in his collected works from the fr:Bibliothèque de la Pléiade. An English translation under the hand of Ronald Srigley was published in 2007 by the University of Missouri.
