The International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP) is an academic conference devoted to applications of group theory to physics. It was founded in 1972 by Henri Bacry and Aloysio Janner. It hosts a colloquium every two years. The ICGTMP is led by a Standing Committee, which helps select winners for the three major awards presented at the conference: the Wigner Medal (1978–2018), the Hermann Weyl Prize (since 2002) and the Weyl–Wigner Award (since 2022).
