The International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics is a significant international conference series in the field of neutrino physics, during which talks detailing notable progress in theoretical and experimental work are given.  In addition, the conference reviews the status of proposed research in neutrino physics and astrophysics. Held every two years, the conference programs consist of plenary sessions with invited speakers, poster sessions and short evening talks.  The shorthand designator for a particular conference is "Neutrino" followed by its year, e.g. Neutrino 2011.
The first conference was held in Balatonf√ºred in 1972; however, three preceding conferences are often referenced with respect to the history of the Neutrino series. These meetings include the 1965 Informal Conference on Experimental Neutrino Physics at CERN; a 1968 conference in Moscow sponsored by the Academy of the USSR, which was organized just after certain cosmic ray neutrino events were seen in the gold mines of India, South Africa and Utah; and a 1970 meeting in Cortona.
Each conference is organized by the Co-Chairs and is supervised by a changing International Advisory Committee as well as the permanent International Neutrino Commission. The latter is assembled from the chairs of former conferences. George Marx was the founding chair of INC until the end of 2002 conference, followed by Jacob Schneps until the end Neutrino 2014 and the current chair is Stephen Parke. The primary purpose of the INC is to chose the Co-Chairs for future conferences, which typically also determines the location of that conference.
This conference series encompasses many different branches of neutrino  physics and neutrino astrophysics and is currently held bi-annually, rotating roughly between Europe, the Americas and Asia/Oceania. A list of the 
conferences with links to the proceedings either written or virtual is
