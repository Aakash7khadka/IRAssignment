Holons are one of three quasi-particles, along with spinons and orbitons, that electrons in solids are able to split into during the process of spinâ€“charge separation, when extremely tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero. The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital location and the holon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.
