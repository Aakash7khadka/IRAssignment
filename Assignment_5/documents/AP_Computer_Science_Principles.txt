Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles (also known as AP CSP) is an AP Computer Science course and examination offered by the College Board under the Advanced Placement program. The course is designed as an equivalent to a first-semester course in computing. Assessment for AP Computer Science Principles is divided into two parts: a Create Performance Task due during the course, as well as an AP exam.
AP Computer Science Principles examines a variety of computing topics on a largely conceptual level, and teaches procedural programming. In the Create "Through-Course Assessment", students must develop a program, demonstrated in a video and a written reflection. The course may be taught in any programming language with procedures, mathematical expressions, variables, lists, conditionals, and loops. Coding portions of the AP exam are based in both text-based and block-based pseudocode, as defined by the provided reference sheet.
The AP Computer Science Principles Exam was administered for the first time on May 5, 2017.
